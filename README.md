<i class="fab fa-github">This is my personal [Data Analytics Porfolio](https://danielryvero.github.io/danielryveroanalytics.github.io/).</i> 
I will be updating it with my most recent work in this field. 
Data Analysis - related code will be hosted and commented by me at my repo for [Data Analytics Projects](https://github.com/danielryvero/Portfolio-Projects-Data-Analytics).

Eventually I will be sharing the guidelines to become a data 
analyst, and what it is in my opinion, the best path to get there.

Feel free to copy and ask!
