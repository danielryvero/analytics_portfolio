This is my personal data analytics porfolio. It is hosted at https://danielryvero.github.io/danielryveroanalytics.github.io/
I will be updating it with my most recent work in this field. Eventually I will be sharing the guidelines to become a data 
analyst, and what it is in my opinion, the best path to get there.
